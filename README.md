## ponytown info ^_^
- been playing since late 2020 i am DEEP in the pony trenches
-  whisper to interact always !! even if i'm not offtab i am still really inattentive and easily miss messages
- no c+h unless it's with someone i know. otherwise i'll just move
- don't copy or take inspo??? this is an unspoken rule it's a little sad i have to say it
- i personally don't support tt/td, but i don't care that much in the first place. do what you wanna do, who am i to tell you no lol
- i try to avoid anyone under the age of 15. no offense!! i just don't wanna seem like a weirdo talking to kids on the internet when i am the grown age of 17 !!!
